# Section

A section block represents a section of the website. It can contain varying components and accepts a `bg` prop along with all other BoxProps.

## Regular Section

Can be used anywhere and can follow another regular block.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={SectionStories.DefaultSection} />
</Canvas>

## Angular section blocks

These are used for page headers and newsletter blocks by default, but can appear elsewhere in a page if needed. Avoid placing the blocks one after another, and intersperse them on the page with regular and slanted blocks.

### Angular Section left

<Canvas>
  <Story of={SectionStories.ExtendedLeftSection} />
</Canvas>

### Angular Section right

<Canvas>
  <Story of={SectionStories.ExtendedRightSection} />
</Canvas>

## Slanted section blocks

Have a 2° slant (178° to get this specific rotation) at the top of the block. This degree should be maintained despite the length of the block. Should not follow another slanted section block.

In terms of aspect ratio, the slanted part measures 1440x82px.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={SectionStories.SlantedTopSection} />
</Canvas>
