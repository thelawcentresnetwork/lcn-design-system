# Callout

The Callout component accepts rich text, and aims to highlight text on a page

## Default

These are used to highlight important or pertinent items of information on a page. They’re used across 6 or more columns. They are used outside the flow of text as standalone items.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={CalloutStories.DefaultCallout} />
</Canvas>

## Short

These are used when highlighting short bits of content, over fewer than 6 columns.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={CalloutStories.ShortCallout} />
</Canvas>

## Long

These are mostly used to highlight quote remarks within the flow on text on the news pages but can be used anywhere there’s a long flow of content

<Canvas>
  <Story of={CalloutStories.LongCallout} />
</Canvas>
